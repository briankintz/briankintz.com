## Work

Currently I'm a Senior Cloud Solution Architect at TEQWERK, where I use my background in cloud-native infrastructure, software development and DevOps to guide companies of all sizes on their journey to the cloud.

Before that I built IAV's private cloud and was responsible for on-premise Kubernetes, Ceph and GitLab, as well as driving the adoption of public and hybrid cloud services.

Over the years I've had an active voice in evolving modern enterprise IT architecture and am renowned as a leader for DevOps methodology and cloud technology.
