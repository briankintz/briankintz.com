      <p>Work's fun, but so are lots of other things!</p>
      <p>I love learning new things, which leads to an abundance of hobbies.</p>
      <p>
        On any given day you can find me cooking, climbing, sailing, skiing,
        dancing or just strumming along with some music on the guitar.

      <p>And I loved it all!</p>
